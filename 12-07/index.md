Re-Positioning – 07.12.
The question I asked the class in this session was:
Do you plan on collaborating with someone else from the class? If so, what's your strategy, when  and how will you find a team?
<br />
<br />
Questions asked by each student to others
Pragmatic/organisational - preBA thesis
- What are you looking for, when choosing a mentor? e.g. qualities or past
experiences... (Andreas F)
- Where do you see the biggest challenges for your BA project?
- Would you like to meet as a class before the BA seminar in January to find a
possible partner for your project? (Lilian)
- Do you plan on collaborating with someone else from the class? If so, what’s your
strategy, when and how will you find a team? (Colin)
Topic of BA thesis
- During our studies we looked at many different design directions. do you already
know what kind of bachelor project you want to create? do you want to create
something sculptural, an installation, a performance, an application, etc.? (Yami)
- How would you explain your BA thesis to a 9 year old? (Fabian)
- What led you to and/or inspired your current choice of topic for the BA project?
(Zoe)
Changes during semester
- The questions Joëlle asked during the course were sometimes very personal, I’m
wondering whether during the process of the course you realized things about
yourself - which you haven’t thought about before? Did it enhance or somehow
change the perception you have of yourself? In what way may it influence the
process of your BA-thesis? (Michelle)
- What is the most useful piece of advice you’ve heard during this course (from
lecturer or peer), which you will take forward with you into the BA project? (Zoe)
- Our ideas have developed over many weeks now, from the point where we were
digging within ourselves for topics that fascinated us at an almost unconscious but
also very personal level (e.g. finding books at the library), supposedly to intuitively
show our true beliefs, hopes and ways of acting on the world.
Looking back, is the current state of our project-idea still true to our dreams and
interest or has it become something that we would not have agreed on at the
beginning? (Roman)
Process during thesis
- How does one manages motivation throughout the process of the project?
- To what extent should one continue to research their hypotheses when proven
false? When should you kill your darlings?
- Tips on: how to approach and involve target groups in an iterative design process?
To what extent should the approach be participatory, in order to avoid the “saviorcomplex”?
- When working in a collaborative scenario, how can the group assign leadership for
project management without forming a hierarchical atmosphere?
- How can one avoid biases within different phases of the project? Throughout
research, ideation, production, etc. (Shafira)
- In the past weeks I personally got stuck only making personal thoughts and
philosophising about my thesis, without doing big research. That's why I would like to
ask the following question to my classmates: How do you break free from not only
thinking about your ideas to actually work for your ideas (be it research or
experiments, talking to someone or organising meetings with experts)? (Andreas B)
- Is it more important for you to mould the project or for the project to mould you?
(Andy)
PostBA
- What are your sweet dreams for after the BA? (Pamela)
- What they expect the BA Thesis to be for them, in the context of their careere or
even life. (Damaris)
—Choices of topic
Would you use the bachelor thesis to start a project that you would continue to work
on after you have handed in your bachelor thesis? (Tamara)
Studies in general/interests
- Is there something you regret doing/not doing in the 5 semesters you spent at
ZHdK? (Sophie)
- What else would you like to have to do in your lives? (Tell me about one thing)
- What have you already done and you recommend it to others as well? (Mara)
General design questions
- Decisions are made based on various variables. We can predict the future but will
never know for sure what our creation will bring.
Acting ethical is for every nation especially for every person individually different.
Even if 100 people think and act the same, there is always at least one person who
will do it otherwise. (This can be good or bad). Therefore I wonder how we can
prevent that our creations will be used for rather bad things. _ Example drones for
the war and AI to spy on each other.
If humans cannot be ethical, how can we design ethical neural networks? (Danuka)
- How long is the moment of now and what does it mean? Is time designable?
(Edna)
- How can we as designers survive in a capitalist world and at the same time fight
against/let ourselves not be taken over by the system? (Janina)
- What kind of society are you designing for? (Duy)
- What's the romantic/poetic part of being a designer/interaction designer?
(Charlotte)
