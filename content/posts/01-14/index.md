We had a very joyful workshop this morning. The story telling challenges allowed me to further develop my ideas from a narrative perspective. Story telling really is one of the most powerfull tools in our bags. It allows for checking how water tight your ideas are. Issues in coherence and logic come very apparent once you attempt explaining your concept through a narrative style. What was especially refreshing for myself was the way Nicole guided the sessions. She really took an out of the box
approach to the new remote format we are all forced into. This was a welcome diversion.
