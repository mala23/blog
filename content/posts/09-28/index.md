[Work in Progress]

Where last time we looked at the Action, this time we where discussing the Inter. It was refreshing to not ponder the classical question of «what does interaction design mean to you?», but rather deconstruct the term in a new way.

First we looked at our assignment from last week. Everybody printed and hung a poster relating to student activism. It was astonishing to see the diversity of locations and movements across the globe. I was especially surprised by the fact that almost no doubles where present. Each student found their own movement to present. That shows the rich global history of uprising and protest.

I had brought a poster from the 2019 Hong Kong Protests.

When I went to the wall to hang it, Charlotte hung her poster right next to it, and then proceeded to help me pin my large pin to the wall. Her print showed maoist workers in the iconic poses of the cultural revolution. I later, after the seminar, went and asked her about her decision to bring that specific poster. She pointed out that it showed three women worker. I had completely missed that fact. Apparently Mao used the global women rights movement during the cultural revolution to
encourage women to take on traditionally male occupied carreers. Charlotte pointed out that she has a sceptical view of the parties' reasoning and the effect of this feminsitic movement.
