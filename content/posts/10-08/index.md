[Work in Progress]
Free Flow Retreat – 08. and 09.10.
The transformation I went through during these two days is astonishing to me. When we arrived at the Atelierhäuser am Waldrand on Thursday morning, I felt very agitated. I have had a hard time falling asleep the previous two nights. My head was full of disorganised thoughts and I was anxious about the looming thesis. 
When one turns onto the path leading to the property the first thing you see beneath all the beautiful, huge trees are the animals. The herd is made up from an old, but still mighty black stallion. Some mules, as well as donkeys greeting you. The scene made me feel as if I was walking onto farm property. We got greeted very warmly by the owners Ewa and Stefan. The dog and a band of cats roaming around the lovingly kept houses, together with the hosts made me lighten up a bit right away. The
place has an incredibly magical air to it.

<br />
The point where everything changed for me was our Ideation Speed Dating session on the second day as well as the Idea Embodiment Performances. I got a rush of positive energy and confidence. All will be will.
<br />
<br />
I realised, that there is so much experience and knowledge I am bringing into this, that there is really no rational for the anxieties I felt on the first day. I could take a step back and enjoy the creative vibe. The exceptionally inspiring place, the animals, the nature, the beautiful people around me. I suddenly felt very at ease in the situation of an interaction design Bachelor graduate to be. Two themes that led through these two days for me where biology and the workplace. In Biology I
mainly kept coming around to my strong fascination for fungi. They where everywhere here, it was height of the mushroom season. The forest literally smelled of fungal goodness.

<br />
The idea of regarding the workplace as a design object came to me in the Speed Dating Session.
