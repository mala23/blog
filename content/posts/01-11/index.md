This monday morning we met in class to kick off our BA Concept Seminar. To start things off each of us students gave a one sentence update on our topics. A few new groups had formed during the holidays. I felt disappointet of myself for not having gotten much further in the meantime. Also there was again this mounting pressure building up. Not only do I really want and have to decide on a topic during these two week, I also really have to find someone to work with. Preferably today. All of
this created quite a bit of anxiety.

For the exercise we where tasked with writing 20 different, iterative directions to talk about our topic on post its.

Here are my 20 approaches in the domain of Mycology

Culinary
Mushrooms taste good and are rich in nutrients.

Medicinal
Many species are of medicinal value and have been used as natural remidies for centuries.

Mycofiltration membranes can filter pathogens and chemical toxins.

Mycoforestry can help in preservation of native forests as well as enhance reforestation.

Mycoremediation is the use of mushrooms for econtaminating toxic waste sites.

Mycopesiticides
Mushrooms are used to fight pests such as insects in a natural way.

DIY Mushrooms can be grown at home, with very low effort.

Packaging
There are mycelium based packaging solutions on the market.

Mycophilic vs Mycophobic
Societies have different relations to mushrooms.

Psilocybin is being researched for use in treatment of cancer, addiction, anxiety and depression.

Hunting for mushrooms in the wild can reconnect us with nature.

Mycelium as nature’s internet.

The sharing of mushroom cultures is easy. A spore print fits in an envelope, a small vial of liquid culture can easily be shipped.

Mycelial cultures can be used as beneficial companions in the vegetable garden.

Mushrooms can be grown in the laboratory, on a variety of media such as agar, liquids and substrates.

Mycelium as a material must have many applications that have not been studied yet.
