[Work in Progress]

Where the first two seminars were about the Action and the Inter, this time we would start to position ourselves in writing. In this seminar we first heard excerpts and explanations about a couple of the manifestos we had brought to the class. First off was Futurismo, the Italian artist movement, published 1909. It has to be read in the context of approaching world war and the formation of italian fascism. We then heard about the Hypocratic Oath from roughly 450 B.C. There the formation of the
Red Cross can be looked into as further reference. Die Brücke was a german expressionist artist movement, that published their manifesto in 1905. Die Brücke stood as a youth movement in contrast to the establishement and the impressionist tradition. The Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen from 1793 was the first iteration of the Declaration of Human Rights. It evolved from the french revolution. The Laws of the Indies, published in 1573 was the spanish conquista's set of
laws to deal with indigenous populations among other aspects in their colonies. It has to be considered as a very strong root for many issues around post colonialism and race, we are dealing with to this day.<br />

I had chosen the Declaration of the Rights of MAn and of the Citizen, published in 1793.
[Here is the link to a transcript.](https://www.conseil-constitutionnel.fr/sites/default/files/as/root/bank_mm/anglais/cst2.pdf) It has been translated from french into english.

After this we answered three questions in writing, individually within a set timeframe. Here are my answers.
<br />
Who are you?<br />
Most of the time I feel like I’m still the young boy playing with the children in my neighbourhood and my brother. Dreaming up lively, complex worlds and scenes from thin air. Arguably the thought patterns I used back then are the ones I build up on today. As a designer, programmer, artist and writer.
Analytical thinking, taking apart things and reassembling them back together. Critical thinking and a constant dissatisfaction with the status quo.<br />
<br />
What is your ambition as a designer?<br />
My trusted friend Merriam-Webster defines the word ambition as an ardent desire for rank, fame, or power, as well as a desire to achieve a particular end.
Rank has never had much significance in my deep rooted antiauthoritarianism. I do not have a desire to achieve certain ranks in my career as a designer or anywhere else in my life. Fame similarly is not a clear ambition I have. It can feel nice to be acknowledged by people, I had the chance to experience this to some extent in my time as a DJ. It’s more of a nice side effect of doing good work. Fame definitely has a dark side to it, so it has to be considered with caution if one was to
acquire it. My dad always reminds my brother and me to keep our feet on the floor and stay humble, no matter what happens.
Now, power is different. To me it is something inherit to our role as designers. Therefore it has to be regarded with the utmost attention. No matter in what field we work, our work will have effects on other peoples lives. One of my ambitions is to always be aware of this, and to use my powers as a designer for the good.<br />
<br />
Pick a topic of interest and add to it what you think no one ever heard before.<br />
Someone once showed me a photograph of some government archive, probably of birth certificates or census records. It shows a small room filled to the roof with bundles of paper documents. Framed by these walls of paper sits a clerk typing away on a typewriter. If I recall correctly, that photograph was taken in the current century. When I visit my doctor I am always reminded of that photograph, when he enters the room with my paper health record in hand. On it he writes his indecipherable
notes during the check up. It then gets stowed away until my next visit. Why?<br />
<br />
I am very unsatisfied with the bulk of my answers. Until next week I will take some time to redraft them.
