In this first seminar we looked at the structure for the coming semester. We discussed the upcoming Free Flow Seminar, which sounds very exciting.

We then had to note down our personal answers to two questions. First was what has had an impact on us during the past two years. Second, what kind of contribution had we made during that time?

_What made an impact on you during the past two years?_
There is only one experience I made during the past two years that stands out in a monumental fashion. That is my participations in the Hong Kong protests. I have not made any other experience in my life that compares to this one in intensity and meaning. It has changed me forever.
_What impact did youmake on others around you?_
The fact of being part of a movement this big makes it clear to me how my actions had an impact on the run of history. It's indeniable, that every persons presence at the rallies has impact. That every story shared with other protestors or carried out to the world changes something.

Afterwards we watched two movie excerpts and discussed them in class. The first was «How to Survive A Plague» (David France, 2012), the second «120 BPM» (Robin Campillo, 2013).
The things that stood out to me in the first excerpt was how the movement incorporated experts, like the scientist for example, who had no personal stakes in the movement's goal. They took matters into their own hands by educating themselves and for example putting together a glossary of terminology related to AIDS therapies that everyone should know. In the second excerpt it was astonishing to see how swift, fast and yet strictly structured the group discussed with intensity. I know from
experience how hard this is to achieve. They have clear rules on procedures and in debate, that they constantly remind themselves of and everyone follows. I will watch both of these films in full length.

The seminar was a nice start for the course. It's always nice to get the structure of the coming semester layed out in the beginning, and getting questions answered right away. I'm especially looking forward to the Free Flow Seminar, but anxious about the approach of our thesis year. It was nice to see how despite the very large class – 24 students – we are able to have discussions in a well structured manner.
